# Python dependencies for gh-star-search enhanced features
# These are OPTIONAL - the application works without them but with reduced functionality

# For enhanced summarization (uses DistilBART, ~1.5GB RAM)
transformers>=4.30.0
torch>=2.0.0

# For vector embeddings and semantic search (~200MB RAM)
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0

# Note: The heuristic summarization method has no dependencies
# Install only what you need for your use case
